Hamper another faction’s access to a resource by disrupting it in some way.","3":"Gain Footing. The balance of power between factions tips easily, and you can be the archetype of change.  Gain control of a resource, group, or location that further bolsters your faction’s positioning in the region.","4":"Turn Coat. Nothing stings a faction more than a defector’s betrayal.  Turning a rival faction member to your cause, however briefly, will go a long way towards enhancing your status.","5":"Double Agent.

Pose as a member of a rival faction in a pivotal interaction to initiate the deception.","6":"Scrape Nets.

Your faction can buy time to organize themselves by making sure others aren’t getting the materials they need.

An independent entity has developed a new program that is reported to speed up the technomancy interface required to generate the time portal. It’s being stored on an off-network mainframe in another faction’s territory, requiring you to head behind enemy lines to investigate.","4":"Bolster the Barricade. A defense network has been established around your faction’s chronomancy portal, but there’s been a breach not far from your location.

Staging a civilian rescue mission from the chronomancy rifts would be a small but important step towards clearing the faction’s name.","3":"Gather the Gemstones. Now is the time to procure the magical implements and fetishes of the past.

Additionally, you can see in the dark within 30 feet of you and can always tell how close you are to the surface while underground."},"gnome":{"name":"Gnome","description":"Restless Mind. Gnomes are often defined by their ingenuity and out-of-the-box thinking. As a gnome, your mind is constantly racing, coming to conclusions and deductions faster than you can express them. This restless state of mind allows you to come up with creative solutions on the spot. Once per encounter, you can gain advantage on a Will-based check, including skill checks, of your choice. Additionally, if you spend 1 minute investigating an item, you automatically determine its function and purpose."},"highAuric":{"name":"High Auric","description":"Eye for the Strange. Many humans would describe the underraces as \'magical,\' but in the case of the high aurics, this concept takes on a different dimension of meaning. As a high auric, you can spend 1 minute to sense the presence of ceridium - be it an object or creature - within 60 feet of you. At the GM\'s discretion, you can sense higher concentrations of ceridium from much further distances, and some materials, like lead, can disrupt this ability. Additionally, high aurics are ambidextrous and never suffer from vertigo; when you make an Agility-based check to maintain your balance or perform feats of eye-hand coordination, you gain advantage on that check."},"human":{"name":"Human","description":"Humanity\'s Privilege.

As the most imposing and phenotypically striking underrace, your path hasn\'t been easy, but has forged you into a sturdy opponent with an attitude to match. The other races can use you as cover, and if at any time you have less than half of your hit points remaining, you gain advantage on all Strength-based checks, including skill checks."},"troll":{"name":"Troll*","description":"Not Just a Pretty Face. Your genetic makeup provides for an even more extreme reaction to ceridium exposure than that of low aurics. You tower over most other humanoids, with menacing tusks that instill even the most hardy opponents with fear. The other races can use you as cover, and you gain advantage on all Negotiation checks made to intimidate a creature by drawing attention to your size. Additionally, you gain advantage on all contested Grapple checks made to resist another creature’s attempt to Grapple you."}},"destinyData":{"aurikarElite":{"name":"Aurikar Elite","requirement":"Friendly or higher faction standing with Aurichome","description":"Guns and spells have their places, but you prefer to get your hands dirty.

You provoke a vision by focusing on a subject: a person, place, or object. This vision gives you a sudden hint that aids you in some way, like a window into past events or a premonition of what may come. Such a vision may manifest as seeing yourself walking into a trap, or perceiving the face of an ally that you have yet to meet, or a precognition of a murder that will happen.

You can choose to do so after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used to determine the result of the roll. Rewind (2 ceridium): You rewind yourself immediately to the start of a combat or move action you just took, undoing its outcome. For all purposes, this action never occurred, including any loss of ceridium, equipment, or hit points (you still spend the ceridium cost of this spell). Uncanny Foresight (4 ceridium): You open a portal in time to gain a piece of gear that you forgot to take with you at the beginning of the mission or have otherwise misplaced.
