All humans are created equal, with the operative word being 'humans.' You represent the dominant race on earth, and are treated accordingly. You gain advantage on all Personality-based checks, including skill checks, with a faction of your choice. Additionally, you gain 5 faction points with that faction at the beginning of your first mission.\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    lowAuric: {\r\n                        name: \"Low Auric\",\r\n                        description: \"Too Burly to Care. 'Freak.' 'Tusker.' 'Pig face.' Most humans think of you as stupid or violent, and you've experienced your fair share of derision. As the most imposing and phenotypically striking underrace, your path hasn't been easy, but has forged you into a sturdy opponent with an attitude to match. The other races can use you as cover, and if at any time you have less than half of your hit points remaining, you gain advantage on all Strength-based checks, including skill checks.\"\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        methods: {\r\n            updateRace(raceChoice) {\r\n                this.raceChoice = raceChoice;\r\n            },\r\n            updateClass(classChoice) {\r\n                if (this.classChoice !== classChoice) {\r\n                    this.classChoice = classChoice;\r\n                    this.archetypeChoice = \" \";\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            updateArchetype(archetypeChoice) {\r\n                this.archetypeChoice = archetypeChoice;\r\n            },\r\n            updateFeat(featChoice) {\r\n                this.featChoice = featChoice;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n    #char-gen {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n    #races {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        margin-left: 100px;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n    #classes {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        margin-left: 100px;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n    #archetypes {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n    #feats {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        margin-left: 100px;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n    .archetypes-sub {\r\n        display: inline-flex;\r\n    }\r\n    .feats-sub {\r\n        display: inline-flex;\r\n    }\r\n    #buttons {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: column;\r\n        margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n        margin-left: 10px;\r\n        width: 100px;\r\n        position: fixed;\r\n    }\r\n    button {\r\n        background-color: cyan;\r\n        border-radius: 10px;\r\n        border: 0px;\r\n        height: 50px;\r\n        margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n        font-weight: bold;\r\n        outline: none;\r\n        font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';\r\n    }\r\n    button:hover {\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n        background-color: hotpink;\r\n    }\r\n    @media (max-width: 700px) {\r\n        #buttons {\r\n            flex-direction: row;\r\n            position: relative;\r\n            margin: auto;\r\n            justify-content: center;\r\n        }\r\n        #races {\r\n            margin: auto;\r\n        }\r\n        #classes {\r\n            margin: auto;\r\n        }\r\n        #feats {\r\n            margin: auto;\r\n        }\r\n        button {\r\n            margin-left: 2.5px;\r\n            margin-right: 2.5px;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</style>"]}]}
